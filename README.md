# MerajutASA Platform

**"To weave a digital tapestry that transforms child welfare through transparent collaboration, ensuring every orphaned child receives the care, opportunities, and love they deserve."**

---

MerajutASA is a mission-driven, open-source platform designed to revolutionize child welfare in Indonesia. We build digital infrastructure to connect orphanages, government agencies, corporate partners, academic researchers, and the community. Our goal is to create a transparent, collaborative, and effective ecosystem where every stakeholder can contribute to providing the best possible care and future for children.
