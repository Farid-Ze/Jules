## What is MerajutASA?

MerajutASA is a mission-driven, open-source platform designed to revolutionize child welfare in Indonesia. We build digital infrastructure to connect orphanages, government agencies, corporate partners, academic researchers, and the community. Our goal is to create a transparent, collaborative, and effective ecosystem where every stakeholder can contribute to providing the best possible care and future for children.

This repository is the living heart of our project. Here you will find not just our code, but our architectural decisions, our governance model, our stakeholder engagement plans, and all the documentation that guides our work. We believe in building in the open and invite you to explore, contribute, and join us in our mission.

## Our Guiding Principles

*   **üí° Innovative**: We leverage technology to solve complex social problems with creative, evidence-based solutions. We are always learning and improving.
*   **‚öñÔ∏è Integrity**: We operate with the highest ethical standards and accountability to all our stakeholders. Our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) is a testament to this.
