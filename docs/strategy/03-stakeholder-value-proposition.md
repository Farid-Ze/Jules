# 3. The Stakeholder Value Proposition Canvas

> **Purpose**: To provide a detailed, actionable map of the specific value delivered to each of the five stakeholders using the **Value Proposition Canvas** framework. This document answers the question, "Why will our partners and users be grateful for MerajutASA?" and serves as a guide for product development, marketing, and partnership management.

## Introduction to the Value Proposition Canvas

To ensure our platform creates tangible value, we use the Value Proposition Canvas, a strategic management tool developed by Dr. Alexander Osterwalder. This framework helps us to deeply understand our stakeholders' needs and design features that address them directly.

For each stakeholder, we analyze two sides:

1.  **The Stakeholder Profile (The Circle):** We seek to understand their world.
    *   **Jobs to be Done:** What are the fundamental tasks they are trying to accomplish?
    *   **Pains:** What are the negative outcomes, risks, and frustrations they experience?
    *   **Gains:** What are the positive outcomes and benefits they are trying to achieve?

2.  **The Value Map (The Square):** We map our platform's value back to their profile.
    *   **Products & Services:** Which of our platform's features help them get their jobs done?
    *   **Pain Relievers:** How do our features specifically alleviate their pains?
    *   **Gain Creators:** How do our features help them achieve their desired gains?

A perfect fit is achieved when our Value Map directly addresses the Jobs, Pains, and Gains of the Stakeholder Profile.
