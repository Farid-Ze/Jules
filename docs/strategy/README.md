# MerajutASA Strategic Blueprint

## Purpose of this Blueprint
This collection of documents serves as the comprehensive strategic blueprint for the MerajutASA platform. It synthesizes our core philosophy, long-term adaptive strategies, and stakeholder value propositions into a single, coherent framework. This blueprint is a living document, intended to guide decision-making, development, and community engagement efforts across the entire project.

It is designed to be read and understood by all stakeholders, from the core development team to our government, business, and community partners.

## Core Documents

This blueprint is composed of the following key documents:

*   **[1. The Orphanage-Centric Model](./01-orphanage-centric-model.md)**
    *   **Purpose**: To formally define the "soul of the project." This document details our core philosophy that MerajutASA.id is a platform built *for* orphanages, empowering them to collaborate *with* the five key stakeholders.

*   **[2. The 5-Year Adaptive Plan](./02-five-year-adaptive-plan.md)**
    *   **Purpose**: To outline the long-term strategies that will ensure the platform remains relevant, resilient, and impactful. This includes our plans for adapting to changes in business, regulation, technology, and social needs.

*   **[3. The Stakeholder Value Proposition Map](./03-stakeholder-value-proposition.md)**
    *   **Purpose**: To provide a detailed map of the specific value delivered to each of the five stakeholders. This document answers the question, "Why will our partners and users be grateful for MerajutASA?" and serves as a guide for product development and partnership management.

*This blueprint was initiated based on the strategic alignment discussions held on 2025-08-09. It should be reviewed quarterly to ensure it remains aligned with the project's evolving needs and the external landscape.*
