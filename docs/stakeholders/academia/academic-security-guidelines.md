# Consolidated Academic Security Guidelines

## 1. Purpose
This document establishes the comprehensive security guidelines for all academic research collaborations with the MerajutASA platform. It consolidates and supersedes previous individual guidelines for data, pipeline, and service security to provide a single, authoritative source for ensuring child data protection and research ethics compliance.

## 2. Core Security Principles
All academic collaborations must adhere to the following core security principles:
- **Child Safety First**: The protection of child data and privacy is the primary consideration in all activities.
- **Least Privilege**: Researchers will only be granted access to the minimum data and services necessary for their approved research.
- **Defense in Depth**: Security controls are applied at every layer of the platform: data, pipeline, and service.
- **IRB Compliance**: All research activities must have and maintain approval from a recognized Institutional Review Board (IRB).

## 3. Data Security Requirements
This section governs the security of the data itself.
- **Anonymized Data Only**: Researchers will only have access to de-identified datasets for research purposes. No direct access to Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of children is permitted.
- **Secure Data Transmission**: All data transmitted between the MerajutASA platform and academic institutions must use secure, encrypted protocols.
- **Secure Research Environments**: Researchers must maintain a secure data environment with strong access controls for any approved data they handle.
- **Ethics and Training**: All researchers must complete ethics training and maintain any required institutional security certifications to access platform data.

## 4. Research Data Pipeline Security
This section governs the secure processing and handling of data within research pipelines.
- **Privacy-Preserving Processing**: All data processing must be done in a way that preserves the privacy of individuals.
- **IRB Compliance Validation**: Research pipelines must include mechanisms to validate and enforce IRB compliance throughout the data lifecycle.
- **Longitudinal Study Protection**: For longitudinal studies, child identities must be protected through robust pseudonymization techniques.
- **Secure Data Delivery**: The delivery of research data to academic institutions must follow secure, audited pathways.

## 5. Research Service & API Security
This section governs the security of services and APIs used for academic collaboration.
- **Institutional Authentication**: Access to all research-related services and APIs requires secure, institutional authentication.
- **Secure Communication Protocols**: All service and API interactions must occur over secure, encrypted communication channels (e.g., TLS).
- **Privacy-Preserving Interactions**: Services must be designed to be privacy-preserving, minimizing the exposure of sensitive information.
- **Access Control & Audit**: All service access must be governed by strict, role-based access controls and all interactions must be logged in a comprehensive, immutable audit trail.
- **Service Mesh Policies**: All research services are subject to the platform's service mesh policies for secure inter-service communication.

## 6. Grounded Links
These guidelines are built upon the following core platform documents:
- **Primary Security Policies**:
    - [Data Protection Policy](../../architecture/security/data-protection.md)
    - [Data Pipeline Security Policy](../../architecture/security/data-pipeline-security.md)
    - [Service Mesh Policies](../../architecture/security/service-mesh-policies.md)
- **Related Academic Guidelines**:
    - [Research Ethics Guidelines](./ethics-guidelines.md)
    - [Data Anonymization Procedures](./data-anonymization.md)

## 7. Changelog
- 1.0.0 (2025-08-08): Initial version, consolidating `data-security.md`, `research-pipeline.md`, and `service-security.md`.
