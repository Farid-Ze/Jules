## Purpose
This guide provides a central starting point for journalists, media partners, and content creators. Our goal is to equip you with clear, safe, and accurate information to report on MerajutASA's mission while ensuring the absolute safety and privacy of the children we serve.

## Scope & Audience
This document is for anyone creating public-facing content about MerajutASA, including:
- **Primary Audience**: Journalists, editors, producers, and photo/video teams.
- **Secondary Audience**: Communications staff, designers, and partner organizations coordinating media efforts.

## How to Collaborate with Us
We welcome media collaboration and have a structured process to support you while protecting our community.

1.  **Understand the Rules of Engagement**: Before you begin, please review our [Media Guidelines](./media-guidelines.md). These rules are designed to protect children and ensure reporting is accurate and respectful.
2.  **Get to Know Our Brand**: Our [Brand Guidelines](./brand-guidelines.md) detail how to use our name, logo, and other assets correctly. Adherence to these guidelines is required.
3.  **Find Assets and Information**: The [Press Kit](./press-kit.md) is your source for approved assets, boilerplate text, and impact metrics. All information you need to build your story is located there or linked from there.
4.  **Request Interviews or Custom Assets**: If you need to speak with a subject matter expert or require specific assets not found in the press kit, please consult our [Expert Contacts & Request Process](./expert-contacts.md).
5.  **Ensure Compliance**: All published content must comply with our core policies, especially regarding [Child Safety](./../community/safety/README.md) and [Privacy by Design](../../architecture/compliance/privacy-by-design.md).

- **Attribute Correctly**: Attribute work to "MerajutASA" as specified in our [Brand Guidelines](./brand-guidelines.md).

### ❌ Don't
- **Never Identify Children**: Do not publish any personally identifiable information (PII), including names, faces, specific locations, or other identifying details about children.
